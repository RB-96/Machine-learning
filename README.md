1. image denoising using MLP and CNN
This is like a comparative study on MLP and CNN models. The accuracy is shown here. MNIST data set of hand written digits is used for the model training and testing. Due to insufficient device compatibility I divided the whole 60k training dataset into taining and testing dataset and run the program on GPU runtime.

2. Classify CIFAR-10 dataset
CNN model has been used to classify the data into 10 classes.
